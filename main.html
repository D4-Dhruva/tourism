                        Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of
                        the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares,
                        in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan
                        in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed
                        in 1648 AD, with the mosque,the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer
                        courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence
                        of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting
                        the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers,
                        painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of
                        the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran.Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of
                        the Taj Mahal.

                        The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad
                        – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan.
                        Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent
                        to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with
                        which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a
                        row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the
                        Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the
                        zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level
                        of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each
                        pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a
                        fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning
                        and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings
                        and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Situated in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati is known for
                        Lord Venkateshwara Temple, one of the most visited pilgrimage centers in the world.
                        It is also one of the world's richest temples known by different names - Tirumala Temple,
                        Tirupati Temple, and Tirupati Balaji Temple. Tirumala is one of the seven hills in Tirupati,
                        where the main temple is located. The temple is believed to be where Lord Venkateshwara took
                        the form of an idol and is home to the deity Govinda. Tirupati is one of India's oldest cities
                        and is mentioned in many ancient Vedas and Puranas.Tirupati is the main town, while Tirumala
                        Hills is where Tirupati Balaji Temple is situated. Also called Sri Venkateshvara Swami Vaari
                        Temple, it is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, believed to be a form of Lord Vishnu, who appeared
                        on earth to save mankind from kali yuga. The famous Tirupati Laddoo, given as a prasad at the
                        temple, has the Geographical indication tag, which means it can only be made and sold at the
                        temple. It is hugely loved by the pilgrims and is generally included in the paid darshan tickets
                        or can be bought from the laddoo counters inside the temple complex. Many devotees also tonsure
                        their heads as an offering to Lord Venkateswara Swamy once their wish is fulfilled or to get rid
                        of their sins and ego. It is done free of cost at Kalyanakatta buildings. Another popular ritual
                        at Tirupati Temple is Thulabaram, wherein a devotee sits on one side of the weighing balance scale.
                        In contrast, the other side is filled with materials (like sugar, jaggery, tulsi leaves, banana, gold,
                        and coins) more than the weight of the devotee. This ritual is mostly performed with children and
                        infants.The non-stop chanting of ‘Om Namo Venkatesaya,’ the mad pilgrim rush, and the 8-feet tall idol
                        of Lord Venkateshwara – everything about the Sri Venkateshwara Temple is majestic. Spread over an area
                        of 26 kilometers and is visited by nearly 50,000 pilgrims daily. The Padmavathi Temple, dedicated to
                        Goddess Padmavati, consort of Lord Venkateswara, is situated at Tiruchanoor in Tirupati town.
                        Many devotees believe they should visit Goddess Padmavati and seek her blessings before visiting
                        Lord Venkateswara Swamy at Tirumala.

                        There are other temples in Tirupati too that you can visit, including the Sri Kalahasti temple, Sri Govindarajaswami Temple, the Kondandarama Temple, the Parashurameshwara Temple, and the ISKCON temple. Tirupati is home to a unique geological wonder that you shouldn’t miss out on! The Silathoranam is a natural arch formed out of rocks and is located at the Tirumala Hills.

                        Bodh Gaya is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in Gaya District of Bihar.
                        Famous for the Mahabodhi Temple, It was here under the Bodhi tree
                        that Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment.It is now one of the
                        UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and a lot of foreign countries,
                        including Japan and China, have helped the Indian government
                        in building facilities for the Buddhist pilgrims. The place is
                        bustling with pilgrims all through the year from India and abroad
                        who come to pay their homage in monasteries, temples and remnants of Bodhi Tree.
                        Located near the river Neranjana, Bodh Gaya was earlier known as Uruwela.
                        It was also known as Sambodhi, Vajrasana or Mahabodhi until the 18th century CE.
                        It is one of the four important Buddhist sites that include: Kushinagar, Lumbini and Sarnath.

                        The very first mention of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple can be
                        found in the Puranas including the Kashi Khanda (section) of
                        Skanda Purana. Interestingly, this temple has seen complete
                        annihilation and rebuilding many times over the course of history.
                        The first time the temple was destroyed was in the year 1194 by the
                        hands of Qutb-ud-din Aibak's army when he defeated the King of Kannauj.
                        The temple was rebuilt during the rule of Delhi's Iltutmish and was
                        demolished again during Sikander Lodhi's time. Raja Man Singh rebuilt
                        the temple during Mughal Emperor Akbar's rule. In 1669 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb
                        destroyed the temple and built the Gyanvapi Mosque in its place. Also known
                        as the Golden Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, it was finally rebuilt in the
                        year 1780 by the Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, the Maratha monarch.
                        The temple comprises of two domes covered in gold donated by the Sikh Maharaja
                        Ranjit Singh, the Punjab Kesari, while the Bhosales of Nagpur donated silver to
                        the temple. Since 28 January 1983, the temple has become the property of Uttar
                        Pradesh government and was managed by Dr Vibhuti Narayan Singh and later by the Kashi Naresh.
